## When to use this checklist

For any runs greater than 15 minutes, where you care about the optimal amount of reincarnation points.

## Checklist

### Preparation

- If you haven't already done this, consider spending ~30 minutes with a Confection pet team equipped, to help boost your Reincarnation Exp confection bonus.
- Ensure you get as many waves cleared on the highest difficulty possible, in order to boost your "Waves cleared" multiplier.

#### Clearing waves

1. Get as far as you can reach on Hard.
2. Once you get to a zone where you can clear lower than wave 300, but greater than wave 200, switch to Medium on the next zone.
3. Once you get to a zone where you can clear lower than wave 200, but greater than wave 100, switch to Easy on the next zone.
4. Push Easy until you cannot push past wave 50. (Even if you can only clear wave 50, switch to the next zone).

### Right before reincarnating

- Equip a pet team with the maximum amount of "Reincarnation Exp Earned" available.
- If you have a set of gear specifically to boost "Reincarnation Exp" (recommended), equip all of those pieces.
  - Note: Ensure you lock all of the pieces of gear you wish to keep! It is easy to instinctively press the "Salvage All" button and accidentally salvage your good gear.
- If you intend on doing so and have it unlocked, now would be the time to spend Residue on Page 2 -> Reincarnation Exp.

### Reincarnate!

- Press the button :)

### After reincarnating

- Switch your pet team (consider a temporary class exp pet team)
- Switch your gear back, if relevant
