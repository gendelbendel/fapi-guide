## When to use this checklist

If you are planning to ascend or planning to ascend soon, double check this list first.

## Checklist

### Preparation - sub 24 hours

Around 24 hours before you believe you'll be ready to ascend, first check the [Priorities doc](/en/guides/ascension-priorities) for your current ascension to see if it has a "Prepare for next ascension" section, and follow those steps.

Then, consider the following:

#### Whack Focus

- Save at least 1 charge of your manual "Whack Auto Play" feature (the one that gives you up to 5 daily charges). This is essential: You will not be able to set a new "Best Ascension Token Bonus" without this or a manual game.
- If you have Expedition unlock, begin running 8 hour runs of a strong team in Orange Mountain, to stack more Whack Bonus.
- Level a team of pets to maximize Whack Bonus, with a secondary priority of Milk.
- Consider having some of these whack pets in an Expedition Team temporarily, for the Rank bonus.
- Make a talent tree (you don't need to save it) where you prioritize first all 300% of Reincarnation nodes, and secondly grab as many Confection nodes as possible.
- If your Whack Score in Infinity Corner is super, super low (which most spreadsheets will encourage)... Consider buying a level or two.

#### Cards

- If you have cards unlocked, save charges such that right before you ascend, you have 5 charges to spend.

#### Residue

- Page 1 of the Residue shop stays in between ascensions and does not get reset. If you're close to important upgrades here, and a Residue focused pet team will get you over that threshold, consider doing that.

### Right before Ascending

1. Read the [Before Reincarnating: Preparation](/en/checklists/before-reincarnating#preparation) section to prepare your reincarnation. DO NOT YET REINCARNATE, JUST PREPARE TO.
2. Equip your best pets for Reincarnation Exp
3. Take note of the level you need to ascend by viewing the "Ascension" tab.
4. Check to see if the amount of Reincarnation levels you would get for reincarnating puts you over the required level to ascend.

If you're short reincarnation levels, you're not ready to ascend yet. Stop following the guide here, and go back to preparing for your last reincarnation.

If you would have enough levels to meet the ascension requirements if you were to reincarnate (AGAIN: DO NOT REINCARNATE YET), and followed the previous [preparation](#preparation---sub-24-hours) steps, you can move on.

#### Juice the Whack Score

- Run a Confection pet team for an amount of time that you're okay with (10-60 minutes) with as much poop in Confection Page 4 -> Whack Score as possible. Any spare Larva goes into it as well.
- After you finish your Confection run...
- Move ALL of your milk into Whack Bonus (page 2)
- If your expedition team is in Orange Mountain currently, cancel the run to have any waves it completed in that run count towards your current bonus.
- Equip your full Whack Bonus pet team.
- Pre-A10: Ensure the gear you are wearing is of the highest base you have available, and spend all of your materials evenly across each piece to ensure highest Whack bonus on gear.
- Look at your cards and see what you might gain from charging Whack once. There is no magic number here, but chances are that the potential upgrade using 1 charge is a pretty large jump in percentage, and worth considering.
- If you decided its worth charging Whack, charge it once now.
- If, for some reason, you had "Whack Score" disabled on Skull page 4, click on the infinity symbol and upgrade whack as many times as you can with your current skull count.
- Go to the Whack page and click the "i" button so you can see the information containing "Current Token Bonus", "Best Ascension Token Bonus", and "Highest Token Bonus".

Your "Current Token Bonus" _should_ be much higher than you've ever seen before, and it should also be much higher than "Best Ascension Token Bonus" as well as much higher than "Highest Token Bonus".

If that is NOT the case, triple check the list above to make sure you have everything setup properly. Triple check how fast the whack score pets are leveling; you may be able to get a few more % by waiting a tiny bit longer.

If you're pleased by the gain there, then finally...

- Click the Whack Auto Play.

#### Get ready to reincarnate

- Follow the steps in [Before Reincarnating: Right before reincarnating](/en/checklists/before-reincarnating#right-before-reincarnating) to prepare for your reincarnation.
- Reincarnate.

### Ascend!

Congratulations :) Ascending is a big achievement and big milestone.
