## Getting Started

To get started with this guide, check out the sidebar for various areas of navigation.

- Guides is a section to help... well, guide you! Different mechanics of the game will show up here, and each doc will be its own place to give guidance on that area.
- Checklists is a section used to help keep you organized and not forget to perform certain actions (like equipping your reincarnation pets before reincarnating! D'oh!)
- Resources is a section dedicated to spreadsheets, websites, and other various tools to help you along the way on your journey through this game.
