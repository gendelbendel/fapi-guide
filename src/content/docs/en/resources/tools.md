## Websites

- [FAPI Tools](https://fapi-tools.vercel.app/), a very WIP site to help automate some of the work of the FAPI_Info spreadsheet by importing save data
- [FAPI Pets](https://zy4m.github.io/fapi-pets/), a tool built for showing off all the available pets and combos, along with a search and filtering feature
- [FAPI Expedition](https://trigunshin.github.io/fapi/), a tool built that allows you to upload a save file and optimize expedition teams based on current damage, but also has support for card charge optimization
